## Writing tests on jest and looking further into it.
 
 test('if Shark agility increases', () => {
        index.Shark.agility = 1
        index.Shark.train2()
        expect(index.Shark.agility).toBe(4)
    })
<!-- whent over  how to run an additional function to make something change. so in the above code agility will increase after train2 is run.-->

<br></br>

## Looked over some ISTQB word defenition in the glossary about testing types.
(https://glossary.istqb.org/en/search/)

<br></br>

## Went over some mock ISTQB exams to try and get some understanding on the wording.

<br></br>

## Looked at HTML and CSS so that i has able to further develop my portfolio which we created.

    <div class="card">
            <img src="img.png" alt="Abdullah" style="width:100%">
            <h3>Abdullah Darsot</h3>
            <p class="title">Graduate Tester</p>
            <p>University of Central Lancashire</p>
            <p><a href= "cv.pdf">CV</a></p> <!-- had to learn and research how to link a PDF within my code. I used W3schools to help-->
        </div>

<br></br>

## Had to prepare for my invididual presentation on F1.

<br></br>

## University Presentation and also preparing what to say and do within the presentation to make sure it was at an acceptable level. 

1. the link below is directed to the Q&A session which we recorded.

<br></br>

## Researched on Selenium to try and understnd whats its used for and how to maximise the tool.

<br></br>

## Had to go over cucmber tests and understand the logic. Since the code wasnt mine I had spend time outside of the office to understand what the code does and which part did what. This was vital since the tests work on logic it would have been extremely hard to write tests. 

<br></br>

## Went into a call during PD to help others and also get help with jest tests since i was initaly finindng it difficult. Also within the call I recaped on how to commit things to git hub.

<br></br>

## Learnt windows comand line prompts to make it easier to do things (http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2015/1102-fall/Command%20Prompt%20Cheatsheet.pdf)
